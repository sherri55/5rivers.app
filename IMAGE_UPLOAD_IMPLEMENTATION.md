# Image Upload Implementation for JobModal

## Overview

The JobModal has been successfully updated to support image uploads instead of just image URLs. The implementation includes a complete backend and frontend solution.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Image Upload Service

- **Upload Service** (`src/services/uploadService.ts`):
  - Handles file validation (type, size, signatures)
  - Generates unique filenames with timestamps
  - Stores files in organized folders
  - Provides cleanup utilities

- **Server Setup** (`src/index.ts`):
  - Added Express server for file uploads (port 4001)
  - Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
  - Static file serving for uploaded images
  - CORS support for frontend requests

- **GraphQL Schema** (`src/schema/typeDefs.ts`):
  - Added `images: [String]` field to Job type
  - Added `images: [String]` to CreateJobInput and UpdateJobInput
  - Maintained backward compatibility with `imageUrls`

### 2. Frontend Image Upload Components

- **Image Upload Service** (`src/lib/services/imageUpload.ts`):
  - Smart fallback: tries backend first, then mock for demo
  - Validation utilities for file type and size
  - Preview URL creation helpers

- **JobModal Updates** (`src/components/modals/JobModal.tsx`):
  - File input with drag-and-drop styling
  - Image preview grid with thumbnails
  - Remove image functionality
  - Upload progress indication
  - File validation with user feedback
  - Memory leak prevention (URL cleanup)

- **GraphQL Queries** (`src/lib/graphql/jobs.ts`):
  - Added `images` field to all job queries and mutations
  - Maintained backward compatibility

## Key Features

### File Upload UI
- Drag-and-drop style upload area
- Multiple image support
- Image previews in a responsive grid
- Individual image removal
- Upload progress indicator
- File validation feedback

### Backend Features
- 5MB file size limit
- Image type validation (jpg, png, gif, webp)
- File signature verification
- Organized storage by folder
- Static file serving
- Error handling

### Data Handling
- Images stored as array of URLs in database
- Backward compatibility with legacy `imageUrls` field
- Proper cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Graceful fallback to mock service for development

## Usage

### Creating a Job with Images
1. Open JobModal (create mode)
2. Fill in job details
3. Click or drag images to upload area
4. Preview images appear automatically
5. Remove unwanted images using X button
6. Save job - images are uploaded and URLs stored

### Editing a Job with Images
1. Open JobModal with existing job (edit mode)
2. Existing images are displayed in preview
3. Add new images by uploading
4. Remove existing or new images as needed
5. Save changes - new images uploaded, URLs updated

## File Structure

```

├── src/
│   ├── services/uploadService.ts     # File upload handling
│   ├── index.ts                      # Server with upload endpoint
│   └── schema/typeDefs.ts            # GraphQL schema updates

├── src/
│   ├── lib/services/imageUpload.ts   # Upload service & utilities
│   ├── components/modals/JobModal.tsx # Updated modal with upload UI
│   └── lib/graphql/jobs.ts           # Updated queries & mutations
```

## Configuration

### Backend Ports
- GraphQL Server: 4000 (default)
- File Upload Server: 4001
- Static Files: http://localhost:4001/uploads/

### Frontend Configuration
- Upload endpoint: `http://localhost:4001/api/upload`
- Fallback to mock service if backend unavailable
- File size limit: 5MB per image
- Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Storage**: Replace local storage with AWS S3/Cloudinary
2. **Image Processing**: Add thumbnail generation and optimization
3. **Batch Upload**: Support drag-and-drop of multiple files at once
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress bars
5. **Image Editing**: Basic crop/resize functionality
6. **CDN Integration**: Serve images through CDN for better performance

## Migration Notes

- The `imageUrls` field is maintained for backward compatibility
- Existing jobs with `imageUrls` will continue to work
- New jobs will use the `images` array field
- No data migration required - both fields coexist

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready image upload solution that enhances the user experience while maintaining system reliability and backward compatibility.
